# JavaScript_Game_Project
This project is a web-based, top-down 2D game engine built using the p5.js library. It features a robust "Game Loop" architecture that separates the Main Menu from the Core Gameplay using an iframe-based overlay system. The project emphasizes procedural map generation, persistent user settings, and a complete asset management system.
